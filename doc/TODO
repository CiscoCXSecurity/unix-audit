* Convert what can i.. to unix-audit checks

 * Audit flags
 * Per account locking
* AIX
 * AIX VIO Servers use a padmin console, to limit the privileges/commands available for (mis)use; similar to the enable command on Cisco devices
 * Run AIX/VIOS Command with padmin/root Privileges in VIO Server
 * Login as user padmin into VIO server: padmin/<padmin_password>
 * Now you can run any AIX command at the padmin console without jumping to root like so: print "lsvg -l rootvg" | oem_setup_env
 * To gain root access on VIO server like so: oem_setup_env
 * You run lsmap -all VIOS command like so: /usr/ios/cli/ioscli lsmap -all
 * By default the ioscli commands are not available for the root user. All ioscli commands are in fact calls of /usr/ios/cli/ioscli with the command as argument. So you can use all ioscli commands as user root by appending /usr/ios/cli/ioscli in front of the command
